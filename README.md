Developed a Python-based Page Object Model (POM) automation framework for e-commerce workflows, covering product selection, dynamic price validation, quantity updates, and end-to-end checkout. The framework leverages Selenium WebDriver, robust exception handling, and dynamic element interaction to ensure reliable test execution across complex web pages. It automates validation of price, quantity, and checkout logic, significantly reducing manual regression testing time, improving accuracy, and enhancing maintainability, making it highly efficient for commercial application testing.
